Feature: Update products using PUT API

  Scenario Outline: validate put product api status code works correctly
    Given I hit the url of put products api endpoint
    When I pass the url of products in the request with <ProductNumber>
    Then I receive the response code as 200
    Examples:
    | ProductNumber |
    | 6             |
